Webpage-Assignment

The webpage was an assignment where the objective was to make a brand new webpage for a company called "Canyon Hikers"

The objectives were to design and code a webpage that featured a brand logo, sound, and an animation. With a few personal added goals I desingned the webpage to feature
2 articles, 2 sub articles, an navbar with a search bar, a brand logo with an animated branding name title in the navbar, and a footer with socials attached.
Each article was designed so that when the user clicks on the button or picture there would be a link inside of the  it would take them directly to the article 
that corresponded with the button or picture.

The languages and tools used for this project were HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AdobeXD, and PhotoShop.

The design and case study can also be seen on my dribbble account here: https://dribbble.com/shots/16559567-UX-CASE-STUDY-ASSIGNMENT
